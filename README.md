## How to Use

1.  **Download the Project:**
    Save the HTML file to your local machine.

2.  **Open in Browser:**
    Open the `index.html` (or the renamed file) in any modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

3.  **Enter Base Values:**
    In the highlighted `USD` row for either table, enter the base values for **Min Bet**, **Default Bet**, and **Maximum Bet**.

4.  **View Results:**
    The corresponding values for all other currencies in that table will update automatically.

5.  **Sort Data:**
    Click on the **Currency** or **Multiplier** headers to sort the data. Clicking the same header repeatedly will cycle through ascending, descending, and the original order.

## Customization

You can easily customize the currency lists by editing the JavaScript arrays directly within the HTML file.

1.  **Locate the Data Arrays:**
    Inside the `<script>` tag, find the `originalLvcCurrencies` and `originalStandardCurrencies` arrays.

2.  **Add or Edit Currencies:**
    Modify the arrays by adding, removing, or editing the currency objects. Each object follows this structure:

    ```javascript
    { 
        name: 'USD - United States Dollar', 
        multiplier: 1, 
        symbol: '$',
        symbolPosition: 'after', // Optional: 'after' or undefined (defaults to before)
        tooltip: 'This is a tooltip.' // Optional
    }
    ```

3.  **Special Multipliers:**
    For currencies with different multipliers for min/max bets (like CNY), use an object for the `multiplier` property:
    ```javascript
    { 
        name: 'CNY - Yuan Renminbi *', 
        multiplier: { min: 5, def: 5, max: 10 }, 
        displayMultiplier: '5/10', // Text to show in the table
        symbol: 'Â¥', 
        tooltip: 'Uses a multiplier of 5 for Min/Default and 10 for Max.' 
    }
    ```
